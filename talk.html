## Global shipping of _on-demand_ products in **Solidus**

???

Introduction: I'm Alex, backend developer at Lostmy.name, where I have been
working for the past _almost_ 3 years.

_short pause_

Today I'll be going through some of the fun, and experimentation, we had with
Solidus trying to set it up for our
particular use case:

**delivering magical, personalised products to our customers
all around the globe.**

_pause_

NEED TO EXPLAIN A BIT MORE OF WHAT THIS IS GONNA BE.

how to personalize products and ship the globally

show the Q4 books.

cut out some of the bad part -- focus on the right part.

moving the lessons to the beginning


STARTED ON SPREE ----> MOVED TO SOLIDUS

started 2015 - had nothing
2015 sep moved to spree -
2016 UPSTREAM XXX
2017 - enabled

--------

MENTION THAT customisable === QUANTITY 1
customisable = not the color; arbitrary text - customisation can't be solved
by variants.

I have worked with (Spree) ... Solidus for the same amount of time as I have been at Lostmy.name.

We have some unique requirements and we are constantly pushing
Solidus to do more things!

---

class: center, middle

<img src="img/products.jpg" width="100%"> </img>

???

By now, I'm sure you guys are aware what we do at Lostmy.name: these beautiful
print-on-demand personalised products. To help us sell these products our website
is powered by Solidus on the backend and ReactJS frontend.

But let me take you guys baaaack to the start... 3 years ago; when we didn't know
**most** of the things that we know today, mainly we didn't know that there is
a "Spree-way" of doing things!


---

class: center, middle

<img src="img/algo.jpg" width="600px"> </img>

???

When we started we were 3 engineers and neither of us had very much e-commerce
experience, so having a base project (with _some_ guildelines) made a massive
difference.
Nonetheless, we still felt like everyday we were creating _bespoke algorithms_.
_The tshirts are a running joke of when our CEO was on TV and was asked how our
books are created and said that: "we have a bespoke algorithm"._

So, what was our website before solidus?

It that had very basic concepts of ecommerce: `Order` `Book` `Payment`.

Then we moved to solidus.

Basically looked like this. Switch slides now.

---

class: center, middle

<img src="img/tricycle.jpg" width="600px"> </img>

???

It can go places, but it's pretty damn slow, not very weather proof, and
you can't make a lot of enhacements. So we went to solidus.

---

class: center, middle

<img src="img/cockpit.jpg" width="600px"> </img>

???

Going from that... to this ........ it was quite a change.

Now... I'm not joking. Solidus does really feel like this ...

## See the ERD

---

class: center

<img src="img/erd.png" height="500px"> </img>

???

We went from a simple website to a very intricate, feature-rich e-commerce
engine. We had **no idea** what we subscribed to!! We obviously wanted a system
that would scale, but going from 4 models to two dozen was a **very** big chance.

We were not ready to start thinking about `line items` `inventory units`
`shipping rates` `stock items`. We wanted to sell **personalised** childrens books.

Sure, it shouldn't have to be that hard??


---

class: center, middle

### _Personalized_ content

???

We started at our basic need - to be able to have customisable products,
and sell them.

We thought - "OK, this is a big project; someone probably done
this before, right?"
So we started to look for _solidus_ extensions that would allow us to customise
a product.

_ I have to say at this point we still didn't fully understand what
**product options** and **variants** fully were, and how to use them._

---

class: center, middle

### OK - We have to write our own

???

After a few days of looking around and tying a few extenions, we decided,
that _unfortunately_, we have to write our own **product customisation**
code.

---
class: center, middle

### Sure, no problem

???

We sort of know what we have to do... or so we thought.

---
class: center, middle

### But what do we actually write?

???

Ok - it's a new model! Great!!

But where does it fit in the puzzle?

What values will it contain?

_Important to specify that at this point we only had an `enGB` softback book
available for boy/girl.
We knew we gonna do a hardback book and more languages; as well as other products
but not a lot more than that._

We still had a lot of questions and **doubts** about how to really model this new
thing.

---
class: center, middle

### We really need to understand what these variants are

???

How many of you are familiar with the product, product options, option
values; and variants?

Well, worry not, I will try to clarify it.

---

class: center, middle

### Product & Product Option Types

<img src="img/product-option-types.png"> </img>

---

class: center, middle

### Variant & Option Values

<img src="img/variant.png"> </img>

---

class: center, middle

### Our use-case

<img src="img/lmn-prod-types.png"> </img>

???

So we create a new product **Lostmy.name book**.

The product has the product options of `gender` and `locale`. At this point we
don't have a product option for the `cover_type` (softback vs hardback) - because
we were not that forward thinking _ loads of regrets about this_.

Now what should the variants be?

#### Anyone want to guess?

---
class: center, middle

### `lmn:softback:boy:en-GB`
### `lmn:softback:girl:en-GB`.

???

Notice how we added _softback_ in there, although we don't actually model that
in the product option? ...

Yep - that was problematic.

---
class: center, middle

### `Customisation`

REMOVE SPREE FROM CUSTOMISATION

<img src="img/li-cust.png"> </img>

???

So we have variants, and line items. Line items felt like the right place for
attaching the customisation. They are created when someone adds something to
the cart, so it's perfect.

_ We also evaluated attaching the customisation to `InventoryUnit` - but
those generated and regenerated at basically every step of the checkout stage._

---
class: center, middle

### Reminder: We were on Spree 2.0

???

Yep.

Things are a lot better in terms of how objects are generated and used today
compared to back then. (about 3 years ago!); and things are improving everyday!!
which means that any newcomer won't have to struggle with some of the things
we had to.

At this point, we had a place to store our customisation options, ie: name,
dedication.

---
class: center, middle

### Model - âœ…
### Controller - âœ…
### Other decorators - ðŸŽ„

???

At this point:

- we have a model
- we have a link to an existing Spree model

We need to create a new route, put together a controller and a view to add a new
Lostmy.name book to the cart.

---
class: center, middle

### Book in cart!

???

We got to this point - it felt great; but also very overwhelming. We were using
Spree, but we had **a lot**, and I mean **A LOT** of decorators.
Now that we have something in the cart, surely, it should be easy to checkout,
as we didn't change any of that logic? ... right? right?

From the cart - we only had to tweak the generation of inventory units - as our
items were unique to properties that were not determined by the variant. Lets
not talk too much about this now - as it's a whole other list of surprises.

Now enter the 2nd complication of our business: multiple stock locations (global shipping)
as well as `on demand` products.

---
class: center, middle

### Stock (Inventory)

???

We operate an on-demand business, but we still have some _stock_ on the premises
of our stock locations. When we launched with 1 book it was an easy problem to
solve. But now we have over 90 variants, that have different availabilities
throughout the world.

As we are adding more products we have to start to **really** manange the
inventory in solidus.

Thankfully, here we were able to use the solution from Spree, which is the
StockItems table and view.

It looks like this now.

---
class: center, middle

<img src="img/admin-stock.png"> </img>

???

although we **still** don't know why we have negative counts; we have a few ideas
but we are not 100%. can't say we spent too much time trying to fix/or change it
as this is something that _just works_.

Imagine that we have 90 variants(spread across 5?? 6?? products) x 10 stock locations = ~900 entries
in the StockItems table.

---
class: center, middle

### Stock Locations

???

Again, we were able to use this concept from Solidus. We added some additional
fields to be able to cope with our shop's specific requests such as: daily
capacity, working days, holiday calendar, etc.

---
class: center, middle

### Shipping Methods

???

Here we had to tweak a lot. Originally, in _Spree 2.0_ the shipping method
has no connection to the stock location; but only a connection to the zone
(the destination); meaning if you had more methods shipping to the same zone,
it was impossible to distinguish them.

---

class:center, middle

### Shipping Methods, Zones

<img src="img/sm-zone.png"> </img>

???

Meaning it looked like this. For a business like LMN, who was shipping from the
UK to the US, and also from US to US; this was creating problems.

It's important to say here that we also added some custom fields to the `ShippingMethodZone` table
to hold information such as shipping duration for that shipping method to that zone.

Initially we worked around this limitation; by modelling around this limitation.

But as the business requirements changed, and we had to start creating some magic.
Soon afterwards, we onboarded a new `stock location` and our house of cards
collapsed; and again we had to write _bespoke algorithms_.

It all started with commits like this.

---

class: center, middle

<img src="img/commits.png" width="1000px"> </img>

???

dark days.

---

class: center, middle

<img src="img/sl-sm-zone.png"> </img>

???

Then we introduced the relationship between stock-location and shipping method,
this enabling us to have a full chain of SOURCE----DESTINATION modeled.

This change is upstreamed into Solidus, but I'm not sure how many people are
aware of it - and how many use it; but it was something that definitely help us.

---

class: center, middle

### Data model âœ…

???

At this point, we thought we had a good data model for this shipping side of things.

Now back to the cart!!

We were now looking to actually order a `book`. Sounds easy right?

---

class: center, middle

<img src="img/book-in-box.jpg" width="100%"> </img>

???

It should be just putting books in a box, then adding a shipping label.

O'boy.

Lets start at the basics - creating a shipment.

---

class: center, middle

### Coordinator

#### Builder
#### Priotizer
#### Estimator
#### Validator

???

Again - here we tried to ue the default objects and flow from Solidus.

These are the default components that ship with `Spree`. There are some changes
in how these components behave that have happened since we started using Spree
and the current version of Solidus, but mainly their responsabilities stayed
the same.

**Builder** - builds **all** possible packages (one for each stock location with
the available stock items).

**Prioritizer** - (the only place where you can customise) - sorts the packages based
on a rule (customisable), then balances(adjusts) the packages - so you are left only with the
minimal subset of packages that added together == order contents

**Estimator** - creates the shipping rates for the packages

**Validator** - validates that the items in the packages == the order contents (qty checks)

---
class: center, middle

### OK - lets _decorate_

???

Initially we had to decorate the method in the prioritizer doing the sorting of packages.

---
class: middle

```
def sort_packages
  # order packages by preferred stock_locations
end
```

???
And with code like this in the Solidus repo, what else could've we done?

Better write some custom code now. It will definitely resist over time.

Of course - we now have 2 stock locations - which makes this logic very easy.
If it's in the US, then use A; otherwise use B.

Lets see some code, _I_ wrote, about 3 years ago.

---
class: middle

```
def sort_packages
  # If it's the US make sure to select the package from riverside
  # If it's not the US make sure to select the package from charlesworth
  if order.ship_address.country.iso == "US"
    stock_location_id = Spree::StockLocation.friendly.find("riverside").id
    selected_package = packages.select { |p| p.stock_location.id == stock_location_id }
    selected_package = selected_package.first
    packages.unshift(selected_package)
  else
    ...
  end
end
```

???

After decorting this method we looked further down the flow, and realised we have
to also _decorate_ (read: _rewrite_) the adjustment phase of the `Prioritzer`.

---

class: middle

```
adjuster = @adjuster_class.new(line_item.variant, line_item.quantity, :on_hand)

# Make sure we pass the line item so that we can validate that it's the right
# item we are picking!
# Important for us since the customisation is not reflected in the variant
visit_packages(adjuster,line_item)

adjuster.status = :backordered
visit_packages(adjuster,line_item)

```

???

We also had to decorate the `adjusting` of packages, since our items attributes
cannot be determined just from the variant, and we needed to pass the `line_item`
(which then holds the `customisation` connection) to validate what we are adjusting.


### Important to say that this has been upstreamed; as well as some other optimisations around the `Estimator`

---

class: center, middle

### We decorated. A LOT.

???

At this point we've been hacking at the internals of Spree for about 1 month,
trying to decorate, tweak decorations... and basically we got to a point where
we didn't know what code was ours, and what code was coming from Spree.

However, we worked **hard** to get to this point, but basically:

normal spree installation - our spree installation.

---

class: center, middle

<img src="img/normal.jpg" width="350x"> </img>
<img src="img/decorated.jpg" width="350px"/>

???

However, we worked **hard** to get to this point, but basically:

## normal spree installation - our spree installation.



---
class: center, middle

### Can we purchase a book now?

???

After we sorted out the generation of shipments - we were onto the payment stage.
Thankfully, things did **just** work here, and we had a complete order.

God, it's been a long journey - with a lot of learning on our side, both about
e-commerce in general, and about Spree/Solidus in particular.

---
class: center, middle

### Lesson 1: Personalised Products & Solidus

???

It's not that hard as it sounds! As soon as you undertand the underlying model
and moving parts of Solidus, you can attach a model the `LineItem` and from there

...

the SKY is the limit

## HOWEVER

1. We still have some hacks around our codebase,
for example: handling giftwrap & the pricing of it.

2. State machines are very convoluted. We added our own, and now we have to sync
the order, shipment, customisation (our). NOT FUN.

---
class: center, middle

### Lesson 2: Complex shipping rules

???

Combine the on-demand & complex shipping rules - this turned out to be `hard`.

At this point we are also looking at how we can make some more improvements in
the `Coordinator` flow to allow us to adapt to changing business rules.

---
class: center, middle

### Lesson 3: Engage with the community

???

There are **A LOT** of smart people out there; and **A LOT** of them use
Solidus.

We reached out to the Spree core, and now Solidus Core teams often - and get
people's opinions on new challenges, as well as consult with them on how we
are thinking of solving them.

A few times, we asked Clarke:

`Hey how would you do this?`

`Well, it's great that you ask. We've done this previously ......`

Being able to have these interactions has been very helpful for the direction
that we went with our decorations, as well as getting rid of them.

Jordan - who we're super happy to have working at LMN, we know what are the longer
term plans for Solidus.

---
class: center, middle

### Lesson 4: Keep moving forward!

???

Business requirements change often, and we have to review our code and previous
_decorations_ (or hacks, as I call them).
