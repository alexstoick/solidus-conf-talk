## Global shipping of _on-demand_ products in **Solidus**

???

Introduction: I'm Alex, backend developer at Lostmy.name, where I have been
working for the past _almost_ 3 years.

_short pause_

Today I'll be going through some of the fun, and experimentation, we had with
Solidus trying to set it up for our
particular use case:

**delivering magical, personalised products to our customers
all around the globe.**

_pause_

I have worked with (Spree) ... Solidus for the same amount of time as I have been at Lostmy.name.
We have quite a specific set of requirements and we are constantly pushing
Solidus to do more things!

When we started we were 3 engineers and neither of us had very much e-commerce
experience, so being able to have a base project to work from made a big difference.

_The tshirts are a running joke of when our CEO was on TV and was asked how our
books are created and said that: "we have a bespoke algorithm"._

We had a previous website, that had very basic concepts of ecommerce: `Order`
`Book` `Payment`. Then we moved to solidus.

Basically looked like this. Switch slides now.

It can go places, but it's pretty damn slow, not very weather proof, and
you can't make a lot of enhacements. So we went to solidus.

Going from that... to this ........ it was quite a change.

# Enter Solidus

<img src="img/erd.png" height="500px"> </img>

???

We went from a simple website to a very intricate, feature-rich e-commerce
engine. We had **no idea** what we subscribed to!! We obviously wanted a system
that would scale, but going from 4 models to two dozen was a **very** big chance.

We were not ready to start thinking about `line items` `inventory units`
`shipping rates` `stock items`. We wanted to sell **personalised** childrens books.

Sure, it shouldn't have to be that hard??

### _Personalized_ content

???

We started at our basic need - to be able to have customisable products,
and sell them.

We thought - "OK, this is a big project; someone probably done
this before, right?"
So we started to look for _solidus_ extensions that would allow us to customise
a product.

_ I have to say at this point we still didn't fully understand what
**product options** and **variants** fully were, and how to use them._

---

### OK - We have to write our own

???

After a few days of looking around and tying a few extenions, we decided,
that _unfortunately_, we have to write our own **product customisation**
code.

---

### Sure, no problem

---

### But what do we actually write?

???

Ok - it's a new model! Great!!
But where does it fit in the puzzle?
What values will it contain?

_Important to specify that at this point we only had an `enGB` softback book
available for boy/girl.
We knew we gonna do a hardback book and more languages; as well as other products
but not a lot more than that._

---

### We really need to understand what these variants are

???

So we create a new product **Lostmy.name book**.

Now what should the variants be?

#### Anyone want to guess?

The product will have the product options of `gender` and `locale`. At this we
don't have a product option for the `cover_type` (softback vs hardback) - because
we were not that forward thinking _ loads of regrets about this_.

---

### `lmn:softback:boy:en-GB`
### `lmn:softback:girl:en-GB`.

???

Notice how we added _softback_ in there, although we don't actually model that
in the product option? ...

Yep - that was problematic.

---

### `Spree::Customisation`

???

So we have variants, and line items. Line items felt like the right place for
attaching the customisation. They are created when someone adds something to
the cart, so it's perfect.

_ We also evaluated attaching the customisation to `InventoryUnit` - but
those generated and regenerated at basically every step of the checkout stage._

---

### Reminder: We were on Spree 2.0

???

Yep. Things are a lot better in terms of how objects are generated and used today
compared to back then. (about 3 years ago!).

LineItem <--> Variant
|--> Customisation

???

At this point, we had a place to store our customisation options, ie: name,
dedication.

---

### Decorators

???

At this point:

- we have a model
- we have a link to an existing Spree model

We need to create a new route, put together a controller and a view to add a new
Lostmy.name book to the cart.

### Book in cart!
