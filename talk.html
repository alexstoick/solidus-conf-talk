## Global shipping of _on-demand_ products in **Solidus**

???

Introduction: I'm Alex, backend developer at Lostmy.name, where I have been
working for the past _almost_ 3 years.

_short pause_

Today I'll be going through some of the fun, and experimentation, we had with
Solidus trying to set it up for our
particular use case:

**delivering magical, personalised products to our customers
all around the globe.**

I have worked with (Spree) ... Solidus for the same amount of time as I have been at Lostmy.name.
We have quite a specific set of requirements and we are constantly pushing
Solidus to do more things!

When we started we were 3 engineers and neither of us had very much e-commerce
experience, so being able to have a base project to work from made a big difference.

_The tshirts are a running joke of when our CEO was on TV and was asked how our
books are created and said that: "we have a bespoke algorithm"._

We had a previous website, that had very basic concepts of ecommerce: `Order`
`Book` `Payment`. Then we moved to solidus.

We went from a simple website to a very intricate, feature-rich e-commerce
engine. We had **no idea** what we subscribed to!! We obviously wanted a system
that would scale, but going from 4 models to two dozen was a **very** big chance.

We were not ready to start thinking about `line items` `inventory units`
`shipping rates` `stock items`. We wanted to sell personalised childrens books.
